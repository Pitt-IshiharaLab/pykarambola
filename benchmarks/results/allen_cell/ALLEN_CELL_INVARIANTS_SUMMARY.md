## Interpretation

### Eigenvalue gain diminishes with polynomial degree

The most consistent pattern across both symmetry groups is that explicitly adding eigenvalues
(the three sorted eigenvalues of each rank-2 tensor) produces diminishing gains as polynomial
degree increases:

| Degree | SO3 Δ Eigen | SO3 Δ Beta (vs +E) | SO2 Δ Eigen | SO2 Δ Beta (vs +E) |
|--------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | +12.6 pp | +2.1 pp | +12.5 pp | +1.0 pp |
| 2 | +3.4 pp | +1.0 pp | +3.0 pp | (not run) |
| 3 | +0.9 pp | (not run) | (not run) | (not run) |

**Why**: Each rank-2 tensor W has three fundamental SO(3) invariants — I₁ = Tr(W),
I₂ = (Tr(W)² − Tr(W²))/2, and I₃ = det(W). Degree-1 polynomial invariants capture only I₁;
eigenvalues add I₂ and I₃, hence the large +12.6 pp gain. Degree-2 already recovers I₂
through cross-tensor products, so eigenvalues only add I₃, giving +3.4 pp. Degree-3
encodes all three invariants, leaving eigenvalues to provide only a pre-computed, better-
conditioned representation — +0.9 pp.

The beta gain (+1.0–2.1 pp at degree 1) follows the same diminishing pattern: beta indices
(β = (λ₁−λ₃)/trace) are not expressible as linear combinations of eigenvalues, so they add
genuine signal to a linear classifier at all degrees. The smaller beta gain for SO2 vs SO3
at degree 1 (+1.0 pp vs +2.1 pp) reflects partial overlap with the z-axis orientation
scalars already present in SO2 D1 features.

### SO3 Degree 2 + Eigenvalues + Beta is the best polynomial invariant set

Adding beta (anisotropy indices, 6 features) on top of SO3 D2 + Eigenvalues pushes performance
from 0.817 to **0.827** — +1.0 pp — and establishes a new overall best, surpassing
Minkowski (tensors+eigen+beta) at 0.818 by +0.9 pp.

The beta gain is consistent but smaller at lower degree: +2.1 pp for D1 (0.793→0.814) vs
+1.0 pp for D2 (0.817→0.827). This mirrors the eigenvalue gain pattern — diminishing returns
as polynomial degree increases — because beta indices (β = (λ₁−λ₃)/trace) are algebraically
related to the higher-degree invariants already present in D2.

SO3 Degree 2 + Eigenvalues (0.817) remains the best set without beta:
- Better than SO3 Degree 3 + Eigenvalues (237 features, 0.804) — **degree-3 cubic terms
  hurt by 1.3 pp** when eigenvalues are already present; 180 extra cubic features add
  dimensionality without proportional signal, diluting the eigenvalue subspace
- Better than SO2 Degree 1/2 + Eigenvalues — full SO3 invariance encodes richer cross-tensor
  quadratic products than axial SO2 invariance

The sudden drop from C=225 (SO3 D2) to C=14.9 (SO3 D3) without eigenvalues signals that
the cubic terms are highly collinear; with eigenvalues the classifier recovers to C=988,
confirming the eigenvalue subspace is clean.

The +3.4 pp gain from adding eigenvalues to SO3 D2 (vs +12.6 pp at D1) breaks down as:
cross-tensor quadratic products Tr(WᵢWⱼ) contribute ~2.6 pp over eigenvalues alone, while
eigenvalues contribute ~0.8 pp on top of SO3 D2. Per-tensor shape dominates; cross-tensor
correlations add modest but real signal.

### Which D2 features drive the gain from D1+E+B to D2+E+B?

SO3 D2 adds 31 new features over D1: 10 dot products of rank-1 vectors and 21 Frobenius
inner products of traceless rank-2 matrices. With w010 ≈ 0 for all centered meshes, the 4
dot products involving w010 are near-zero. The remaining 27 active features split into three
groups:

| Group | Count | Formula | What it encodes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `frob_self` | 6 | `‖Tᵢ‖²_F = Tr(Tᵢ²) = λ₁²+λ₂²+λ₃²` | Per-tensor spectral energy |
| `frob_cross` | 15 | `Tr(TᵢTⱼ)`, i≠j | Relative alignment of two tensors' principal axes |
| `dots` (non-w010) | 6 | `dot(vᵢ, vⱼ)` for vᵢ ∈ {w110, w210, w310} | Surface moment magnitudes and mutual alignment |

To identify which group is responsible for the +1.3 pp gain (D1+E+B 0.814 → D2+E+B 0.827),
each group was added independently on top of D1+E+B:

| Feature Set | # Feat | Rank | Bal. Acc | Δ vs D1+E+B | Best C | Best PCA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1+E+B (baseline) | 32 | 32 | 0.814 ± 0.003 | — | 739 | 25 |
| D1+E+B + dots | 38 | 38 | 0.811 ± 0.006 | −0.3 pp | 1000 | 33 |
| D1+E+B + frob_cross | 47 | 41 | 0.820 ± 0.008 | +0.6 pp | 12.3 | 45 |
| D1+E+B + frob_self | 38 | 32 | 0.826 ± 0.003 | +1.2 pp | 1000 | 38 |
| D1+E+B + frob_all | 53 | 47 | **0.830 ± 0.005** | +1.6 pp | 1000 | 50 |
| D2+E+B (ceiling) | 63 | 56 | 0.827 ± 0.009 | +1.3 pp | 739 | 48 |

**frob_self dominates** (+1.2 pp from 6 features), **frob_cross adds modest complementary
signal** (+0.6 pp from 15 features), and **dots are useless or mildly harmful** (−0.3 pp).

The dominance of frob_self is initially surprising — `‖Tᵢ‖²_F = λ₁²+λ₂²+λ₃²` is
algebraically derivable from the eigenvalues already in the feature set. However, for a
**linear** classifier, the squared norms cannot be expressed as linear combinations of λ₁,
λ₂, λ₃: they require an explicit quadratic feature. frob_self effectively adds the second
power of each tensor's spectral content, completing a degree-2 polynomial basis over the
eigenvalue spectrum.

frob_cross (`Tr(TᵢTⱼ)` for i≠j) encodes the relative orientation of two tensors' principal
axes — information that is genuinely absent from per-tensor eigenvalues. Its smaller gain
(+0.6 pp) suggests that cross-tensor alignment is less discriminative than per-tensor spectral
energy for this task, or that the signal it carries is partially captured by the beta
anisotropy indices already present.

frob_all (0.830) marginally exceeds D2+E+B (0.827) because D2+E+B also includes the
near-zero dot products, which add 10 features of noise and push the classifier toward higher
regularisation.

**Note on reporting and selection bias.** D1+E+B+frob_all was assembled *after* observing
the ablation results: dots were excluded because they performed poorly, not for reasons
independent of this data. This constitutes post-hoc feature selection on the same folds used
to evaluate it, which inflates apparent performance relative to a pre-specified design.
A partial theoretical defence exists — frob_all is the complete Gram matrix of the rank-2
tensor subspace (all pairwise Frobenius inner products), and excluding dots can be motivated
independently by the near-degeneracy of w010 and the qualitatively different geometric meaning
of rank-1 dot products vs. symmetric tensor alignment. Nevertheless, **SO3 D2+E+B (0.827)
should be treated as the primary, pre-specified result**. The 0.003 pp difference between
D1+E+B+frob_all and SO3 D2+E+B lies within the reported standard deviations (±0.005,
±0.009) and the two sets are statistically indistinguishable. The ablation is best understood
as an interpretation of why D2 works, not as an independent performance claim.

### SO3 Degree 1 + Eigenvalues ≈ Eigenvalues only

SO3 Degree 1 + Eigenvalues (26 features, 0.793) adds only +0.2 pp over Eigenvalues only
(18 features, 0.791). The SO3 Degree 1 traces are I₁ = Tr(W) per tensor, which equals the
sum of that tensor's eigenvalues — already implicit in the eigenvalue set. Adding explicit
traces provides no new information for a linear classifier.

### SO3 outperforms SO2 at the same degree

| Degree | SO3 (no eigen) | SO2 (no eigen) | SO3+E | SO2+E |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | 0.667 | 0.674 (+0.7) | 0.793 | 0.799 (+0.6) |
| 2 | 0.783 | 0.757 (−2.6) | **0.817** | 0.787 (−3.0) |

At degree 1, SO2 has a slight edge (+0.6–0.7 pp): the z-axis asymmetry features add useful
information about nuclear orientation along the imaging axis.
At degree 2, SO3 dominates (+2.6 pp without eigen, +3.0 pp with eigen): the quadratic
Tr(WᵢWⱼ) cross-tensor products under full SO(3) invariance encode richer shape correlations
than the restricted z-axis-preserving SO2 products.

The regularisation contrast between SO3 D1+E (C=1000) and SO2 D1+E (C=13.3) is notable:
SO2 z-axis scalars (v_z, M_zz) partially overlap with eigenvalue projections along the z
direction, causing mild collinearity that forces lower C. SO3 D1 traces, being algebraically
redundant with eigenvalues, introduce no additional collinearity.

SO2 Degree 2 + Eigenvalues (112 features, 0.787) underperforms SO2 Degree 1 + Eigenvalues
(36 features, 0.799) by 1.2 pp despite 76 extra features. The degree-2 SO2 invariants and
eigenvalues span partially overlapping directions without the clean complementarity seen in
the SO3 case.

### Feature count vs performance: diminishing returns above 57 features

| 42 | SO2 D1 + Eigen + Beta | 0.809 | — |
| 39 | SO3 Degree 2 | 0.783 | — |
| 57 | SO3 D2 + Eigen | 0.817 | — |
| 62 | Mink (tensors) | 0.746 | — |
| 63 | SO3 D2 + Eigen + Beta | **0.827** | **peak** |
| 80 | Mink (tensors+eigen) | 0.806 | −2.1 vs peak |
| 86 | Mink (tensors+eigen+beta) | 0.818 | −0.9 vs peak |
| 94 | SO2 Degree 2 | 0.757 | — |
| 112 | SO2 D2 + Eigen | 0.787 | — |
| 219 | SO3 Degree 3 | 0.795 | −3.2 vs peak |
| 237 | SO3 D3 + Eigen | 0.804 | −2.3 vs peak |

Performance peaks at 63 features (SO3 D2+E+Beta). The new peak exceeds the previous best
(Mink tensors+eigen+beta at 0.818) by +0.9 pp using a cleaner polynomial invariant representation.

### Exact zero-variance feature counts for centered mesh data

All Allen Cell nuclei meshes are centered to (0, 0, 0) before Minkowski tensor computation
(verified: w010 = 1e-5 constant for all 5606 samples). Any invariant that is quadratic in
w010 is identically constant and zero-variance. The exact empirically verified counts are:

| Symmetry | Degree | Total | Zero-variance | Non-zero variance |
|----------|--------|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| SO3 | 1 | 8 | 0 | 8 |
| SO3 | 2 | 39 | 1 | 38 |
| SO3 | 3 | 219 | 7 | 212 |
| SO2 | 1 | 18 | 1 | 17 |
| SO2 | 2 | 94 | 2 | 92 |
| SO2 | 3 | 754 | 14 | 740 |

Zero-variance features are exclusively those where w010 appears **twice** in the polynomial
(e.g. `dot_w010_w010`, `qf_w010_W_w010`). Features linear in w010 (e.g. `dot_w010_w110`)
are non-zero variance — they reduce to a rescaled sum of the other tensor's components.
A previous theoretical estimate of ~46 zero-variance features for SO3 D3 was incorrect;
the actual count is 7.

### Observed rank of degree-3 invariants is much lower than nominal

Even after discarding the 7 zero-variance features, degree-3 polynomial invariants include
many near-redundant terms under typical mesh data. Surface curvature is relatively uniform
across medical imaging data, causing the four curvature-weighted tensors (w020, w120,
w220, w320) to be highly correlated (r > 0.95 for many pairs). The observed numerical rank
of SO3 degree-3 features is ~135 of the 212 non-zero-variance features, and ~120 when
data-specific near-redundancies are removed. This explains why SO3 Degree 3 (219 features)
performs only marginally above SO3 Degree 2 (39 features) despite the large nominal
feature count increase.

### Where Minkowski baselines sit

- **Minkowski (tensors, 62)** = 0.746: below SO3 D2 (39 features, 0.783) — raw tensor components
  are a worse representation than polynomial invariants for linear classification
- **Eigenvalues only (18)** = 0.791: beats SO3 D2 raw (0.783) at half the features; nearly matches
  SO3 D1+E (26 features, 0.793) with 8 fewer features
- **Eigen + Beta (24)** = 0.808: ties Minkowski (tensors+eigen, 80) at 3.3× fewer features; the 62
  raw tensor components add negligible information once eigenvalues and betas are present
- **Minkowski (tensors+eigen, 80)** = 0.806: sits between SO3 D2+E (0.817) and SO3 D3+E (0.804),
  but with 23 more features than the better-performing SO3 D2+E
- **Minkowski (tensors+eigen+beta, 86)** = 0.818: previously tied SO3 D2+E (0.817); now
  surpassed by SO3 D2+E+Beta (0.827, +0.9 pp) — adding beta to the polynomial invariant set
  breaks the tie and establishes a new ceiling
