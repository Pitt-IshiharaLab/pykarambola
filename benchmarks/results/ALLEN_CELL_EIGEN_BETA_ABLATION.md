# Allen Cell Nuclei: Eigenvalue & Beta Ablation Study

## Overview

Systematic ablation of eigenvalue and beta (anisotropy index) contributions to Minkowski tensor-based classification.
This study isolates which derived quantities matter most and whether raw tensor components add value once these
invariants are present.

**Classifier**: LinearSVC (liblinear)
**Dataset**: Non-rotated nuclei only (`nuclei/`)
**Optimization**: BayesSearchCV, n_iter=20, 5-fold stratified CV
**Evaluation**: 3 seeds, balanced accuracy + geometric mean
**Input**: `minkowski_tensors_with_eigen_vals.csv`

## Interpretation

### Beta alone (6 features): Signal-bearing but weak

Beta (anisotropy index β = (λ_max − λ_min) / Tr(W)) scores 0.588 ± 0.003 with just 6 features.
This is well above random chance (0.167 on 6-class task) but substantially below eigenvalues alone (0.791).
Beta normalises the anisotropy ratio to [0,1], losing the absolute scale information that eigenvalues retain.
The feature is useful for encoding shape asymmetry but insufficient for the full classification task.

### Eigenvalues alone (18 features): Dominant signal

At 0.791 ± 0.003, eigenvalues alone are competitive and beats:
- CellProfiler (shape only): 0.738
- SO3 Degree 3: 0.795 (despite 219 features)
- SO3 Degree 1 + Eigenvalues: 0.793 (26 features)

The 18 eigenvalues (6 tensors × 3 eigenvalues each from w020, w102, w120, w202, w220, w320) capture
the principal directions and magnitudes of anisotropy across all ranks, providing rich shape information
that a linear classifier can exploit directly.

### Eigen + Beta (24 features): Efficiency sweet spot — 3rd overall

At 0.808 ± 0.001, Eigen+Beta ranks 3rd globally (behind only Minkowski tensors+eigen+beta at 0.818
and SO3 Degree 2 + Eigenvalues at 0.817). Remarkably:

- **Beats tensors+beta** (68 features, 0.796): +1.2 pp with 2.8× fewer features
- **Beats tensors+eigen** (80 features, 0.806): +0.2 pp with 3.3× fewer features
- **Near parity with full Minkowski** (86 features, 0.818): only −1.0 pp with 3.6× fewer features

The C value of 225 (same as CellProfiler) shows Eigen+Beta features are well-conditioned and non-redundant,
requiring no heavy regularisation. All 24 dimensions contribute equally.

### Additive contributions: Beta and eigenvalues work independently

| Feature Set | # Feat | Bal. Acc | Δ vs prior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tensors | 62 | 0.746 | — |
| + Beta | +6 | 0.796 | +5.0 pp |
| + Eigen | +18 | 0.806 | +1.0 pp |
| + Both | +24 | 0.818 | +1.2 pp from beta again |

Despite β being algebraically derivable from eigenvalues (β = (λ_max − λ_min) / Tr(W)), the
contributions are **additive**: tensors+eigen gives +6.0 pp, tensors+beta gives +5.0 pp,
and tensors+eigen+beta gives +7.2 pp (not 6.0 alone). The linear classifier benefits from
having anisotropy pre-computed as a single scalar — it doesn't need to learn the nonlinear
combination from raw eigenvalues or tensor components.

### Raw tensor components become marginal once derived quantities are present

| Feature Set | # Feat | Bal. Acc | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eigen + Beta | 24 | 0.808 | — |
| + Tensors | +62 | 0.818 | +1.0 pp |

Adding the 62 raw tensor components (traces, tensor matrix entries) on top of Eigen+Beta yields only
+1.0 pp (0.808 → 0.818) at the cost of tripling feature count. The raw components are largely redundant
once the eigenvalue and anisotropy information is already present — they represent the same underlying
shape variance expressed in a raw, unrotated basis rather than aligned to principal directions.

### Regularization patterns reveal feature quality

| Feature Set | C | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Beta only | 225 | Well-conditioned, no collinearity |
| Eigen+Beta | 225 | Well-conditioned, all dimensions used |
| Tensors+beta | 1.08 | Very low C: betas slot cleanly into tensor space |
| Tensors+eigen | 977 | Very high C: eigenvalues cause collinearity with raw components |
| Tensors+eigen+beta | 1.08 | Adding betas reduces collinearity by providing normalised scale |

The jump from C=977 (tensors+eigen) to C=1.08 (tensors+eigen+beta) is striking: betas restore conditioning
by encoding anisotropy scale relative to trace, reducing the need for regularisation.

## Efficiency Ranking

For practitioners choosing between these options:

| Rank | Feature Set | Efficiency Score | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| 🥇 | Eigen + Beta (24) | 0.808 / 24 = **0.0337** | Best all-around: 3.4% per feature |
| 🥈 | Eigenvalues only (18) | 0.791 / 18 = 0.0439 | Pure shape anisotropy needed |
| 🥉 | Tensors+eigen+beta (86) | 0.818 / 86 = 0.0095 | If raw components needed (rare) |
| — | Tensors+beta (68) | 0.796 / 68 = 0.0117 | Not recommended vs Eigen+Beta |
| — | Tensors+eigen (80) | 0.806 / 80 = 0.0101 | Not recommended vs Eigen+Beta |

## Recommendations

1. **Default choice**: Use **Eigen + Beta** (24 features, 0.808) for production classification.
   Minimal features, excellent conditioning, 3rd-best performance overall.

2. **Pure invariant-only path**: If avoiding raw tensor components is preferred, Eigen+Beta is already
   the optimal choice — it outperforms all tensor-inclusive variants at 3–4× fewer features.

3. **When to keep raw tensors**: Only if interpretability of individual tensor components (w020, w102, etc.)
   is required. The performance gain (+1.0 pp) does not justify the feature bloat for most tasks.

4. **Comparison to non-Minkowski baselines**:
   - Eigen+Beta (0.808) beats CellProfiler full (0.769) by 3.9 pp
   - Eigen+Beta ties SO3 Degree 2 + Eigenvalues (0.817) and approaches Minkowski full (0.818)
   - But requires 2.4× fewer features than SO3D2+Eigen and 3.6× fewer than Minkowski full

## Runtime

- **Eigen + Beta** (24 features): 8 seconds
- **Eigenvalues only** (18 features): <1 second
- **All conditions combined**: ~30 seconds

The compact derived feature sets are extremely fast to optimize, enabling rapid hyperparameter search.
